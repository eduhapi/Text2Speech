In ancient lands where legends breathe,  
A king of might, who held his wreath,  
His throne adorned with jewels rare,  
Yet pride and love ensnared him there.

He ruled with strength and wisdom’s grace,  
A regal figure, feared in place,  
But on his heart, a shadow fell,  
As whispers in his court did swell.

The beauty of his queen was grand,  
Yet envy’s seed was sown by hand,  
For noble women, fair and bright,  
In secret longed for royal night.

In halls of grandeur, secrets kept,  
Where lust and pride in darkness crept,  
The king’s own gaze, once fierce and proud,  
Was swayed by temptress’ siren sound.

His heart, once loyal to his crown,  
Now wandered through a treacherous town,  
Adultery’s vine did twist and wind,  
In chambers where his honor pined.

The courtiers watched with greedy eyes,  
As virtue fell to compromise,  
The king’s own pride, a blinding storm,  
Unfurled its wrath in lustful form.

His queens and concubines of lore,  
Entwined in schemes and whispered lore,  
Did weave a web of soft deceit,  
That brought the mighty to his feet.

In lavish feasts and moonlit dance,  
His heart was lost to fleeting chance,  
While honor’s light began to wane,  
And shadows danced in his domain.

The throne, once feared, became a jest,  
His reign fell into disgrace, distressed,  
As women’s pride and lustful schemes  
Brought ruin to his golden dreams.

The king, undone by pride’s own hand,  
Saw his empire turn to sand,  
The crown he wore with pride and might,  
Became a symbol of his plight.

So heed the tale of royal fall,  
Where pride and lust, like shadows, call,  
For even kings, with all their might,  
Can be destroyed by darkened light.
